Week 3

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What are you going to work on today?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am going to work on making significant progress within the half term holidays so that I can ultimately create a playable game for the rest of the class. To do that I will get some more information as possible on using scroll x and scroll y.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Success Criteria:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Teacher's?</td>
    <td>Mine?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Enter the given criteria
Have a working prototype of your game by the end of this week’s homework
</td>
    <td>Have made significant progress in my game (enough for it to be playable) by the end of the holidays
Make the rest of the maps</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Diary of Progress

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Beginning of Lesson: What have you done so far? What point of the work are you at?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At the moment I have completed my first map and all of the gameplay included in the map. I have also made all of the sprites and have finished everything occurring before that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Activity:  What are you going to be doing this lesson?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am hoping to finish my second map and possibly all or most of the coding for the newly introduced sprites. I also want to tweak the few flaws in my coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>End of Lesson: What point have you reached at the end of the lesson? Did you meet your goal?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I haven't made any progress so far as I have been stuck on how to use scroll x and scroll y in my game and no matter what I tried, I couldn’t succeed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Evaluation of Learning This Lesson

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What went well: How did I learn? What helped me learn today?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I tried various techniques to try and succeed in using scroll x and scroll y (which unfortunately failed) and I also didn't get distracted as much as the last lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even better if…: What could I do that would be even better? Improvements?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I’m not sure what I could have done better. I thought of all the possible solutions I could find but no matter what, it didn’t work.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
