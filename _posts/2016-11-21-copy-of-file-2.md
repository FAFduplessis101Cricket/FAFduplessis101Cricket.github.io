    <td>The most effective technique for finding ways to change the text styles and backgrounds either to use past knowledge and work to refer back to or searching up your queries on Google. 
In this case, changing my backgrounds I used past knowledge, searching up my desired background on Google and following certain instructions of which I know by heart. 
With the transformation of the text, I referred back to a website we have used before (W3Schools) and scrolling down to find the correct instructions and testing out which colours I liked best with the backgrounds etc.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Before thinking of referring back to past knowledge or past work or even searching up on google, I attempted to try out anything I could to get what I desired without thinking of using more correct/better technique. This is a habit that often recurs in my work and a habit that I need to work on quite a bit. Although that habit did reappear in the lesson, I eventually came to a conclusion (the above). </td>

    <td>To improve my learning for next time, I will hopefully remember to immediately use past knowledge and work or I will use the resources given on Google to come up with a likely correct conclusion - but first I will test it out, experimenting with different types and seeing which would best suit what I'm doing work on. I will also try to work a bit quicker, straight away starting my task and not dawdling.</td>
