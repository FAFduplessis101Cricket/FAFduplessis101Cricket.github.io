    <td>I used information given to me by Mr Keen, first trying to understand the concept and then adding more on to it. At first, I didn't understand the concept of what Mr Keen was showing us but after spending a couple of minutes I started the activity, knowing what I was doing instead of copying and not knowing what to do in the future.

    <td>I believe that no habits limited my learning in the lesson. I did what was needed to be done, first understanding my activities and then wasting no time to get it finished.
