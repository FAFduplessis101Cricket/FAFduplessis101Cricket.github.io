Diary of Progress

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Beginning of Lesson: What have you done so far? What point of the work are you at?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At the beginning of the lesson I had completed all of my main sprites (besides sprites I decided to add later on) and I had partially completed my introduction screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Activity:  What are you going to be doing this lesson?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am finishing the start of the game (including the introduction and the first space of the game, before scrolling was needed) and I am adding any characters that I didn't think of at the beginning. I am also giving most of the fundamental coding for the sprites.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>End of Lesson: What point have you reached at the end of the lesson? Did you meet your goal?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I reached a point where I had completed the introductory scene and the introductory explanation.
I unfortunately didn’t reach my goal though I am hoping to get a lot more work done as homework.</td>
  </tr>

Evaluation of Learning This Lesson

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What went well: How did I learn? What helped me learn today?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I focused on including all of the correct coding needed instead of missing out a bit and creating glitches that were impossible to fix. I payed attention to the detail of my coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even better if…: What could I do that would be even better? Improvements?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I didn't focus as much as I could have and I was annoyed with myself and I didn’t get much work done.</td>
  </tr>
