Diary of Progress

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Beginning of Lesson: What have you done so far? What point of the work are you at?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So far I have made a playable game where everything works except for the continuous reappearances of two sprites. I haven't created all of my sprites.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Activity:  What are you going to be doing this lesson?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be making the rest of my sprites (remaining enemies) and I will fix my bugs (the sprites the reappear out of the blue and other possible bugs that I may find in the game. I will also be making my main character costume more realistic and recognisable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>End of Lesson: What point have you reached at the end of the lesson? Did you meet your goal?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have fixed the bugs and I have improved the quality of my main character.</td>
  </tr>

Evaluation of Learning This Lesson

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What went well: How did I learn? What helped me learn today?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I tried everything I could think of and after a while of testing different methods, I asked Mr. Keen why it wasn't working as I had done everything Mr. Keen had said to do. I also worked without distraction through the entire lesson which allowed me to get some work done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even better if…: What could I do that would be even better? Improvements?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have tried some more simple things to fix my problems as the solution was much simpler than I had originally thought.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
