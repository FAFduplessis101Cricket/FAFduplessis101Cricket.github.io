    <td>First , like before, I tried to understand why certain blocks put together did a certain activity and that did work out, especially since I needed to do some more work on the subject. I also committed to finishing my activities rather than leaving it uncompleted.

    <td>I believe that no habits limited my learning in the lesson. I did what was needed to be done, first understanding my activities and then committing to finishing it.
