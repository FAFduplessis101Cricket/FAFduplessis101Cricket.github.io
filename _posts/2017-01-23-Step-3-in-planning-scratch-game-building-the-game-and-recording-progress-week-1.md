Step 3 Building

Week 1

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What are you going to work on today?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I'm working on making all of my sprites and possibly getting all of the fundamental programming in before I start making a more sophisticated/complicated code for all of my sprites, though simple sprites like boulders could be finished this lesson.
I also want to finish my first basic map.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Success Criteria:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Teacher's?</td>
    <td>Mine?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>having created all of your principal sprites.
collects all of my resources.
Make a significant start on your game.</td>
    <td>make all sprites have a name.
complete all of the fundamental coding
complete my first basic map</td>
  </tr>

Diary of Progress

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Beginning of Lesson: What have you done so far? What point of the work are you at?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I haven't completed anything or in fact started anything in my game so far. I have only planned all of the components in the game (above).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Activity:  What are you going to be doing this lesson?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be creating my first basic background and hopefully I will complete all of my fundamental coding for the game, though before all of this, my sprites will be created and will have names.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>End of Lesson: What point have you reached at the end of the lesson? Did you meet your goal?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unfortunately I got no where near what I wanted though I am planning to do some more work on my game for extra homework. At the end of the lesson I had completed the first background and the main character (Jack Jones), though I had a new idea to add another character for the introduction for the game.</td>

Evaluation of Learning This Lesson

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What went well: How did I learn? What helped me learn today?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned as much information as I could in the limited time given to me for making a scrolling game in scratch and I added as much detail as possible in the one character I could finish in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even better ifâ€¦: What could I do that would be even better? Improvements?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that although the great addition of detail was a good thing, it also served as a time waster for the lesson and if the detail was instead left to do for homework, I could have gotten a lot more work done.</td>
  </tr>
