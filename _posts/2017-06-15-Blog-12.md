    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We exchanged and thought of examples of where our attitude and identity changed when going into a different situation such as from in a science class and then at home.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for the lesson was to ultimately understand the task given to us for homework and to get down some key points in my rough plan for the project.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did. At the end of the lesson, I had the rough picture of what I was going to do for the homework, how I was going to structure it and what certain key points I knew I had to include.</td>

    <td>I focused on the task given as homework as I knew it was extremely difficult and it required quite a bit of work for the short time I had to complete it.</td>
